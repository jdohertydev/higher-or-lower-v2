# Higher or Lower?

‘Higher or Lower?’ is a classic, fun and incredibly simple game that most of us have played in our lives, normally with playing cards. This site has taken this straightforward concept and digitised it. Using pure JavaScript for the logic and supported by HTML and CSS, it allows the user to feel the same adrenaline rush experienced when deciding if the next number will be higher or lower. It is fully responsive and accessable on all devices.
