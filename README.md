# Higher or Lower?

‘Higher or Lower?’ is a classic, fun and incredibly simple game that most of us have played in our lives but  normally with playing cards. This site has taken this straightforward concept and digitised it. Using pure JavaScript for the logic and supported by HTML and CSS, it allows the user to feel the same adrenaline rush experienced when deciding if the next number will be higher or lower. It is fully responsive and accessible on all devices.

## Features

### Existing Features

* Simple colour scheme
    * At the heart of the game’s design is simplicity and this starts with the colour scheme used. A simple yet elegant black and white interface combines with the "Play" font which gives this game a retro, arcade feel. 

* Logo and Heading
    * The logo and heading are centred at the top of the page which makes it easy for the user to see. The logo, which combines the ‘+’ and ‘–‘ symbols, adds a visual element which breaks up the text. 

* Favicon
    * The Favicon is a mirror image of the logo, which keeps design elements consistent.

* Instruction box
    * The instruction box is the first and only thing that the user sees as to not overwhelm or distract them. The language used is persuasive to entice the the user to play and it clearly outlines the game's objectives, which the user will read before clicking the ‘play now’ button and entering the game.
    * When the user has clicked the ‘play now’ button, the instructions are hidden to maximise the game area.

* Game area
    * The user is presented with a simple interface; a number, up and down icons from FontAwesome which are purposely placed on top of each other for good design, as well as ‘higher and ‘lower’ text. 
    * The buttons and text are clickable with the cursor changing to pointer and trigger an onEvent action in JavaScript. 
    * The keystrokes for ‘up’ and ‘down’ have been enabled so users using a keyboard can bypass clicking.

* Container to say if answer is correct or incorrect
    * Traditional green for correct
    * Traditional red for incorrect
    * Flashes in and out
